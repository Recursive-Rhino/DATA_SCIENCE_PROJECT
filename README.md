## About This Repo
Welcome! This is my personal collection of Data Science projects. I'll be regularly updating this repository with new notebooks, code, datasets, and insights. Whether it's predictive modeling, natural language processing, or exploratory data analysis, you'll find a variety of topics here.

**Tech Stack (Common Across Projects):**
- **Languages/Tools:** Python, R, SQL
- **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly
- **Environments:** Jupyter Notebook, Google Colab, VS Code
- **Frontend Enhancements:** HTML/CSS for interactive reports and dashboards

The goal is to showcase practical DS applications, share code for learning, and collaborate with the community.

## Upcoming Projects
I will post all my DS projects here soon! Here's a sneak peek of what to expect:
- Predictive Analytics Dashboard
- Sentiment Analysis on Social Media Data
- Time Series Forecasting for Stock Prices
- Image Classification with Deep Learning
- Customer Segmentation using Clustering

Check back frequently, or watch the repo for notifications. Each project will have its own folder with README, code, and data.
Thank You. . .
